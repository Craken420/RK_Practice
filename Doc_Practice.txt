        npm i cors
            Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is an HTTP-header based mechanism
            that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port)
            other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
            CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request
            to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check
            that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight,
            the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers
            that will be used in the actual request.
        npm i path
